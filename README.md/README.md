# 📈 Data Warehouse Model

The warehouse follows a **Star Schema** design.

### Fact Table

- FactTrips

### Dimension Tables

- DimDate
- DimBike
- DimMember
- DimStation

The model is optimized for analytical queries and Power BI reporting.

# 📊 Power BI Reports

The solution contains four analytical dashboards.

## Executive Dashboard

High-level KPIs including:

- Total Trips
- Member Trips
- Casual Trips
- Average Ride Duration
- Total Stations

---

## Rider Analysis

Analysis by customer type:

- Member vs Casual
- Ride Duration
- Bike Type Preference
- Weekly Usage
- Monthly Trend

---

## Station Analysis

Station performance including:

- Top Start Stations
- Top End Stations
- Ride Duration by Station
- Geographic Distribution

---

## Time Analysis

Time-based insights:

- Trips by Hour
- Trips by Day of Week
- Trips by Month
- Peak Hour Analysis
